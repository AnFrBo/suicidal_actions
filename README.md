# Analysis of Influencing Factors Leading to Suicidal Actions via Linear Regression and Regularization Methods

Every year approximately 800.000 people commit suicide - without including the number of attempted suicides and not or falsely reported cases (World Health Organization, 2018). In order to be able to take countermeasures and develop prevention strategies, the underlying and influencing factors have to be examined.
For the analysis financial (e.g. GDP), political (e.g. terrorism), cultural/social (e.g. HDI/family) as well as socio-economic (e.g. gender) factors influencing suicidal actions are considered.

Nowadays, most data sets are large-scaled which leads to interpretation challenges because a model is explained by many variables. Moreover, explanatory variables in empirical data correlate always a little which causes multicollinearity (Auer and Rottmann, 2011). To tackle this, shrinkage and selection methods in order to reduce the complexity of the data set are applied. 

Due to the combination of several data sets and the attempt to record as many influencing factors as possible, the data to be analyzed tend to
be multicollinear. Besides the regularizing method, the analysis focuses on methods dealing with the detection of multicollinearity.
